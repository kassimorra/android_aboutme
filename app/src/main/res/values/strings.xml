    <string name="bio">The best Instagram bios tend to have a self-description. Things to consider adding: your job title(s), the company you own or work for, some claims to fame, things you love, and what makes you stand out.

Queen Latifah’s Instagram bio does a great job of describing her. In the first line of her bio she writes, ‘Actor/Rapper/Singer/Producer.’ When people visit her fanpage, they’ll learn that she’s more than just an actor and may check out her other gigs to learn more about her.

Plus, that little blue tick shows up on her page, so people will immediately understand that she’s famous when visiting her Instagram account. One of the Instagram bio tips Queen Latifah teaches us is that you can learn a lot about a person even from a short bio.
    To make a good first impression, you need to connect with your audience.

How can you do that? By sharing your interests.

For example Paola Antonini’s Instagram bio shares a subtle hint about who she is and what her Instagram is all about. For her interests, she shares, “Lifestyle | Travel | Gratitude.”

When you see the word gratitude thrown in there, you get a little intrigued. And after scrolling through some pictures, you immediately see that she has a prosthetic leg.

And much of her Instagram includes pictures of her living life, travelling, and having fun, which makes her interesting to follow. Pretty sure her 2.6 million followers agree.

The best bio will always be the one that’s easy to read and takes your most enticing interests, which are two important Instagram bio tips to copy.
    If you’re the owner of a fan page or business, or you’re a public figure, your Instagram bio should include your contact information.

Most people write something like ‘For business enquiries, email name@email.com.’ You can also direct people to your DM for sending messages.

The app company A Color Story includes their email address in their Instagram bio for easy communication. The whole goal of social media is to be social, after all, so making your contact information more accessible is one of those Instagram bio tips you have to follow.
